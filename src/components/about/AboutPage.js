       <p> Sharebook uses the power of giving to change the world. We collect books online
           to donate books and fund literacy initiatives in the Philippines.</p>
       <p> We were founded in 2017 by three students (Jessie/Dea/Chelle) from the Vivixx
           Academy Bootcamp who started this as a project and ended up forming a pioneering
           social charity with a mission to promote literacy.</p>
       <p> Every book donated from us contributes to individual literacy throughout the Philippines
           and the potential for a better life. </p>
       <p> Let us support this mission to create a better children of the next generation! </p>
